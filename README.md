## State-of-the-Art Features and Architecture

Nanowakeword is a holistic, end-to-end ecosystem designed to make building and running custom wakeword models accessible to everyone. It goes beyond simple scripting by integrating multiple automated, production-grade systems that manage the entire lifecycle-from data analysis and feature engineering to advanced training and deployment-optimized inference.

> ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ Each section below contains detailed technical explanations. Click to expand.

<details>
<summary><strong>1. Builds a tiny student Model ↓</strong></summary>

Built-in knowledge distillation - automatically generates a lightweight gate model from any trained model.

Trains a tiny "student" model to mimic the output of a larger "teacher" model.
The student is a stripped-down DNN - always architecture type "dnn" regardless
of what the teacher was - because the goal is maximum speed, not accuracy parity.

``` 
 Loss = alpha * KL(student_soft || teacher_soft)   ← soft label matching
    + (1 - alpha) * BCE(student_logit, hard_label) ← ground truth anchoring
```
Temperature scaling softens the teacher's probability distribution so the
student learns from the full output distribution, not just the argmax.

</details>


<details>
<summary><strong>2. The Production-Grade Data Pipeline: From Raw Audio to Optimized Features ↓</strong></summary>

Recognizing that data is the bedrock of any great model, Nanowakeword automates the entire data engineering lifecycle with a pipeline designed for scale and quality:

*   **TTS Model:** Supports multiple TTS models & Speakers. (Automatic download/Custom)

*   **Phonetic Adversarial Negative Generation:** This is a key differentiator. The system moves beyond generic noise and random words by performing a phonetic analysis of your wake word. It then synthesizes acoustically confusing counter-examples-phrases that sound similar but are semantically different. This forces the model to learn fine-grained phonetic boundaries, dramatically reducing the false positive rate in real-world use.

*   **Augmentation:** The powerful & flexible augmentation engine injects a rich tapestry of real-world acoustic scenarios in real-time. **This includes applying background noise at different SNR levels, (Optional: convolving clips with room impulse response (RIR) for realistic reverberation), and applying various other transformations such as pitch shifting and filtering. This allows a small audio set to be expanded into a larger, more diverse set via stochastic augmentation.**

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3. ISBL: Importance Sampling based on Loss (Dynamic Hard-Example Mining) ↓</strong></summary>

The `nanowakeword` training pipeline introduces a highly optimized, custom sampling algorithm called **ISBL (Importance Sampling based on Loss)**. 

Instead of traditional random sampling or standard curriculum learning (which feeds easy data first), ISBL adopts a smarter "Active Mining" approach. It operates on a simple principle: **Do not waste CPU/GPU cycles on audio samples the model already understands. Focus on the mistakes.** 

The system tracks the individual loss of every single audio sample across the entire dataset and dynamically increases the sampling probability of "hard" examples. To prevent model collapse (overfitting on unlearnable noisy data), ISBL introduces a non-linear smoothing factor.

### 🧮 The ISBL Master Equation
The core logic of the sampler is governed by the following dynamic probability distribution:

<!-- $$
\mathcal{P}(x_i \mid x_i \in C_k, t) =
\frac{
\left(\mathcal{L}_i^{(t-1)}\right)^\alpha + \epsilon
}{
\sum_{x_j \in C_k}
\left[
\left(\mathcal{L}_j^{(t-1)}\right)^\alpha + \epsilon
\right]
}
$$ -->
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://pub-812e108f164d4805821c37cb3d3810f1.r2.dev/images/common/ISBL_Formula.png" alt="Logo" width="400">
</p>

**Where:**
*   **$\mathcal{P}(x_i \mid x_i \in C_k, t)$**: The conditional probability of selecting a specific data sample $x_i$ from class pool $C_k$ at training step $t$.
*   **$x_i, x_j$**: Individual data samples (e.g., specific audio clips) within the dataset. Here, $x_i$ represents the target sample being evaluated, while $x_j$ represents all competing samples within the same pool during summation.
*   **$C_k$ (Class/Category Pool)**: A distinct subset or category of data (e.g., `targets` or `negatives`), isolated via the dataset's index pools.
*   **$t$ (Training Step / Time)**: The current iteration or time step of the training loop, defining the temporal state of the sampling probabilities.
*   **$\mathcal{L}_i^{(t-1)}$ (Loss/Hardness Score)**: The individual loss value computed for sample $x_i$ during its most recent forward pass at step $t-1$. Higher loss signifies higher "hardness". (Note: At $t=0$, before any training occurs, all scores are uniformly initialized to $\mathcal{L}_i^{(0)} = 1.0$).
*   **$\alpha$ (Smoothing Factor)**: A hyperparameter set to `0.75`. It acts as a contrast control that dampens extreme loss values. This prevents unlearnable, corrupted, or heavily noisy audio clips from dominating the batch gradients and causing model collapse.
*   **$\epsilon$ (Epsilon / Stability Constant)**: A tiny positive constant set to `1e-6` serving a dual purpose:
    1. **Mathematical Safety**: Prevents division-by-zero errors or absolute zero probabilities when a sample is perfectly learned.
    2. **Catastrophic Forgetting Prevention**: As the model converges and all individual losses drop near zero ($\mathcal{L} \approx 0$), the equation naturally transitions into a uniform random sampler ($\mathcal{P} \approx \frac{1}{N}$), ensuring balanced baseline revision in later training stages.
*   **$\sum_{x_j \in C_k}$ (Summation Over Class)**: The summation operator (Sigma) that aggregates the computed scores of **all** individual samples $x_j$ belonging to class $C_k$. Dividing the single sample's score by this total sum normalizes the output into a strict probability distribution bounded between $0$ and $1$.

### ⚙️ Architecture & Core Components

To implement the ISBL algorithm efficiently on massive audio datasets, the system relies on two custom PyTorch components:

#### 1. `AdaptiveLossAwareDataset` (Memory & Search Optimized)
This dataset class manages millions of features without crashing system RAM.
*   **Zero-Copy Memory:** Uses `numpy`'s `mmap_mode='r'` to read audio features directly from disk on the fly.
*   **Global Loss Tracking:** Maintains a global PyTorch tensor initialized to `1.0` that tracks the exact $\mathcal{L}$ (loss) for every single sample across all data sources.
*   **$O(\log N)$ Bisect Search:** Finding the correct source file and local index for a global sample ID is traditionally an $O(N)$ bottleneck. We optimized `__getitem__` to $O(\log N)$ using Python's `bisect` algorithm on pre-computed start indices, ensuring blazing-fast data loading.

#### 2. `DynamicClassAwareSampler` (Composition-Driven)
Standard samplers blindly shuffle data. Our sampler acts as the executor of the ISBL equation.
*   **Batch Composition:** It builds exact batches based on user rules (e.g., 32 Targets, 64 Negatives, 32 Noise).
*   **Weighted Multinomial Sampling:** It extracts the raw loss for the requested category, applies the $\alpha$ smoothing and $\epsilon$, and uses `torch.multinomial` to probabilistically select the batch.
*   **Dynamic Replacement:** It intelligently toggles `replacement=False` to prevent the exact same hard sample from appearing multiple times in a single batch.

<details>
<summary><strong>4.  A Modern Training Paradigm: State-of-the-Art Optimization Techniques ↓</strong></summary>

The training process itself is infused with cutting-edge techniques to ensure the final model is not just accurate, but exceptionally robust and reliable:

*   **Super Learning:** ISBL: Importance Sampling based on Loss 

*   **Seamless Large-Scale Data Handling (`mmap`):** The framework shatters the memory ceiling of conventional training scripts. By utilizing memory-mapped files, it streams features directly from disk, enabling seamless training on datasets that can be hundreds of gigabytes or even terabytes in size, all on standard consumer hardware.

*   **Checkpoint Ensembling / Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA):** Instead of relying on a single "best" checkpoint, the framework identifies and averages the weights of the most stable and high-performing models from the training run. This powerful ensembling technique finds a flatter, more robust minimum in the loss landscape, leading to a final model with provably better generalization to unseen data.

*   **Universal Export:** The final trained model is exported to industry-standard formats such as **ONNX** & **PyTorch**, or your own **[Custom](https://github.com/arcosoph/nanowakeword/blob/main/CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md#custom-export-model)** formats (e.g., TFLite, CoreML). This ensures maximum hardware acceleration and platform-agnostic deployment across a wide range of environments, from powerful servers to resource-constrained edge devices.

<details>
<summary><strong>5. The Deployment-Optimized Inference & Server ↓</strong></summary>

A model's true value is in its deployment. Nanowakeword's inference engine is designed from the ground up for efficiency, low latency, and the challenges of real-world deployment:

*   **Stateful Streaming Architecture:** It processes continuous audio streams incrementally, maintaining temporal context via hidden states for recurrent models (like LSTMs/GRUs). This is essential for delivering instant, low-latency predictions in real-time applications.

*   **Integrated On-Device Post-Processing Stack:** The engine is a complete, production-ready solution. It incorporates an on-device stack that includes optional **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)** to conserve power, **Noise Reduction** to enhance clarity, intelligent **Debouncing/Patience Filters** and **Gatekeeper** Super light model that is always running. This stack transforms the raw model output into a reliable, robust trigger, ready for integration out of the box.

*   **Server:** A built-in server that helps run models in any way. All models can be run on the server, or some models can be run on the server while others run locally.The server has strong security measures like API keys, SSL, etc.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>6. Signature Features ↓</strong></summary>

*  **Training Journal:** Training Journal System

    Nanowakeword will include a built-in Training Journal system that automatically records:

    - All Training configuration
    - Model parformence


    This makes model training reproducible, debuggable, and research-friendly.

    Users will be able to analyze:
    - which configuration worked best
    - Which model was the best

    The goal is to make wakeword experimentation easier, transparent, and scalable. Designed for long-term experimentation and reproducible research.

*   **Transparent Live Dashboard:** A clean, dynamic terminal table provides a real-time, transparent view of all effective training parameters as they are being used, offering complete insight into the automated process.

*   **Graph:** An informative graph is available at the end of the training.

*   **Resilient, Fault-Tolerant Workflow:** Long training sessions are protected. The framework automatically saves the entire training state—model weights, optimizer progress, scheduler state, and even the precise position of the data generator. This allows you to resume an interrupted session from the exact point you left off, ensuring zero progress is lost.

</details>

### A Stable & Dependency-Free Workflow

The framework is architected to eliminate the common dependency conflicts that often disrupt machine learning workflows. All required packages are carefully version-managed to guarantee a stable environment from initial setup through to the final training execution.

This design ensures that users can proceed from installation to model generation without encountering environment-related errors, allowing them to focus entirely on building their wake word model.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.9 or higher

### Installation

Install the latest stable version from PyPI for **inference**:
```bash
pip install nanowakeword
```

To **train your own models**, install the full package with all training dependencies:
```bash
pip install "nanowakeword[train]"
```
**Pro-Tip: Bleeding-Edge Updates**  
While the PyPI package offers the latest stable release, you can install the most up-to-the-minute version directly from GitHub to get access to new features and fixes before they are officially released:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/arcosoph/nanowakeword.git
```

## Train Model

The primary method for controlling the Nanowakeword framework is through a `.yaml` file. This file acts as the central hub for your entire project, defining data paths and controlling which pipeline stages are active.

### Simple Example Workflow

1.  **Prepare Your Data Structure:**
    Organize your raw audio files (`.wav`, `flac` etc.) into their respective subfolders or you can generate synthetic data.
      > **Important:** The folder structure shown below is only an example. You are free to store your datasets in any location and use any directory structure or naming convention.

    ```
    training_data/
    ├── positive/         # Your wake word samples ("hey_nano.wav")
    │   ├── sample.wav
    │   └── user_01.aiff
    ├── negative/         # Speech/sounds that are NOT the wake word
    │   ├── adversarial_word.pcm
    │   └── random_speech.wav
    ├── noise/            # Background noises (fan, traffic, crowd)
    │   ├── cafe.wav
    │   └── office_noise.flac
    └── rir/              # Room Impulse Response (If you want)
        ├── small_room.wav
        └── hall.wav
    ```

2.  **Define Your Configuration:**
    Create a `.yaml` file to manage your training pipeline. This approach ensures your experiments are repeatable and well-documented.
    ```yaml
    # In your config.yaml
    # Essential Paths (Required)
    model_type: dnn # Or other architectures such as `LSTM`, `GRU`, `RNN`, `Transformer` etc..
    model_name: "my_wakeword_v1"
    output_dir: "./trained_models"
    positive_data_path: "./training_data/positive"
    negative_data_path: "./training_data/negative"
    background_paths:
    - "./training_data/noise"
    rir_paths:
    - "./training_data/rir"  # (⚠️ It is better not to use it)
    
    # Enable the stages for a full run
    generate_clips: true
    transform_clips: true
    train_model: true

    # Add more setting (Optional)
    # For example, to apply a specific set of parameters:
    n_blocks: 3
    # ...
    steps: 20000
    # ...
    checkpointing:
      enabled: true
      interval_steps: 500
      limit: 3
    # Other...
    ```
    **༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ For a full explanation & all parameters, please see the [`CONFIGURATION_GUIDE`](https://qutorium.arcosoph.com/post/nanowakeword-configuration-guide-pp1ia5).**


3.  **Execute the Pipeline:**
    Launch the trainer by pointing it to your configuration file. The stages enabled in your config will run automatically.
    ```bash
    nanowakeword -c ./path/to/config.yaml
    ```

## Command-Line Arguments (Overrides)

For on-the-fly experiments or to temporarily modify your pipeline without editing your configuration file, you can use the following command-line arguments. **Any flag used will take precedence over the corresponding setting in your `config.yaml` file.**

| Argument            | Shorthand                 | Description                                                                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--config`     | `-c`                      | **Required.** Path to the base `.yaml` configuration file.                                              |

| `--transform_clips` | `-t`                      | Activates the preparatory 'transform' stage (augmentation and feature extraction).                      |
| `--train`     | `-T`                      | Activates the final 'Training' stage to build the model.                                                |
| `--distill`         | `-d`                      | Generate a lightweight lite model via knowledge distillation.                                     |
| `--resume`          | ✗                  | Resumes training from the latest checkpoint in the specified project directory.                         |
| `--overwrite`       | ✗       | Forces regeneration of feature files. **Use with caution as this deletes existing data.**                 |

## Performance and Evaluation

Nanowakeword is engineered to produce state-of-the-art, highly accurate models with exceptional real-world performance. The new dual-loss training architecture, combined with our powerful Intelligent Configuration Engine, ensures models achieve a very low stable loss while maintaining a clear separation between positive and negative predictions. This makes them extremely reliable for always-on, resource-constrained applications.

Below is a typical training performance graph for a model trained on a standard dataset. This entire process, from hyperparameter selection to training duration, is managed automatically by Nanowakeword's core engine.

### 📈 Training Performance Graph

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://pub-812e108f164d4805821c37cb3d3810f1.r2.dev/images/common/training_performance_graph.png" width="600">
</p>

### Key Performance Insights:

*   **Stable and Efficient Learning:** The "Training Loss (Stable/EMA)" curve demonstrates the model's rapid and stable convergence. The loss consistently decreases and flattens, indicating that the model has effectively learned the underlying patterns of the wake word without overfitting. The raw loss (light blue) shows the natural variance between batches, while the stable loss (dark blue) confirms a solid and reliable learning trend.

*   **Exceptional Confidence and Separation:** The final report card is a testament to the model's quality. With an **Average Stable Loss of just 0.0086**, the model is highly accurate. More importantly, the high margin between the positive and negative confidence scores highlights its decision-making power:
    *   **Avg. Positive Confidence (Logit): `5.447`** (Extremely confident when the wake word is spoken)
    *   **Avg. Negative Confidence (Logit): `-5.721`** (Equally confident in rejecting incorrect words and noise)
    This large separation is crucial for minimizing false activations and ensuring the model responds only when it should.

*   **Extremely Low False Positive Rate:** While real-world performance depends on the environment, our new training methodology, which heavily penalizes misclassifications, produces models with an exceptionally low rate of false activations. A well-trained model often achieves **less than one false positive every 16-28 hours** on average, making it ideal for a seamless user experience.

## Using Your Trained Model (Inference)

Your trained `.onnx` model is ready for action! The easiest and most powerful way to run inference is with our lightweight `NanoInterpreter`. It's designed for high performance and requires minimal code to get started.

Here’s a practical example of how to use it:

```python
import pyaudio
import numpy as np
from nanowakeword import NanoInterpreter # Import the interpreter from the library

# Load model
interpreter = NanoInterpreter.load_model(
    r"model/path/your.onnx" # Your Model Path
)

# Setup microphone
pa = pyaudio.PyAudio()

stream = pa.open(
    format=pyaudio.paInt16,
    channels=1,
    rate=16000,
    input=True,
    frames_per_buffer=1280
)

print("Listening...")

while True:
    # Read audio from mic
    audio_chunk = np.frombuffer(
        stream.read(1280, exception_on_overflow=False),
        dtype=np.int16
    )

    # Run prediction
    result = interpreter.predict(audio_chunk)

    # Detection
    if result.score > 0.95:
        print("Detected!")

        # Optional
        interpreter.reset()
```

## 🎙️ Pre-trained Models

To help you get started quickly, `nanowakeword` comes with a rich collection of pre-trained models. These pre-trained models are ready to use and support a wide variety of wake words, eliminating the need to spend time training your own model from scratch.

Because our library of models is constantly evolving with new additions and improvements, we maintain a live, up-to-date list directly on our GitHub project page. This ensures you always have access to the latest information.

For a comprehensive list of all available models and their descriptions, please visit the official model registry:

## ⚖️ Our Philosophy

In a world of complex machine learning tools, Nanowakeword is built on a simple philosophy:

1.  **Simplicity First**: You shouldn't need a Ph.D. in machine learning to train a high-quality wake word model. We believe in abstracting away the complexity.
2.  **Intelligence over Manual Labor**: The best hyperparameters are data-driven. Our goal is to replace hours of manual tuning with intelligent, automated analysis.
3.  **Performance on the Edge**: Wake word detection should be fast, efficient, and run anywhere. We focus on creating models that are small and optimized for devices like the Raspberry Pi.
4.  **Empowerment Through Open Source**: Everyone should have access to powerful voice technology. By being fully open-source, we empower developers and hobbyists to build the next generation of voice-enabled applications.

## FAQ

**1. Which Python version should I use?**

>  You can use **Python 3.8 to 3.13**. This setup has been tested and is fully supported.

**2. What kind of hardware do I need for training?**
> Training can be performed on any modern device, including standard CPUs, without requiring specialized hardware. While a dedicated `GPU` can accelerate the process, it is not necessary. The training pipeline is optimized to run efficiently even on low-end systems.

**3. How much data do I need to train a good model?**
> For a good starting point, we recommend at least 10000+ clean data of your wake words from a few different voices. The total duration of negative audio should be at least 3 times longer than positive audio. You can also create synthetic data using **Nanowakeword**. The more data you have, the better your model will be. Our intelligent engine is designed to work well even with small datasets.

**4. Can I train a model for a language other than English?**
> Yes! Nanowakeword is language-agnostic. As long as you can provide audio samples for your wake words, you can train a model for any language.

**5. What platforms are supported for running the trained model?**
>  Inference (running the model) is extremely lightweight and can run smoothly on almost any device, including a Raspberry Pi 3/4, Linux systems, Android devices, and Apple platforms.

**6. Is there an official C# port for nanowakeword?**
> There are no official ports for C#
